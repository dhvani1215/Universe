            <div class="accordion-body">Mars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially true since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two-thirds of Mars's surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and it could have been habitable since 4.48 billion years ago, 500 million years before the earliest known Earth lifeforms</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">The Milky Way and Andromeda, two big galaxies in space, are on a crash course! In the far future, they will collide and merge into a new, larger galaxy. But don't worry, this cosmic dance happens very slowly over millions of years, and the stars in both galaxies are so far apart that they won't crash into each other. It's like a grand celestial waltz that will create a new and even more magnificent galaxy in the night sky, changing the way our cosmic neighborhood looks.</div>
